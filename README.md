## Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run the following command in the project directory:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configuration**  
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root, or use the "API Keys" dialog in the application.
   - Add your API keys and configuration settings:
     - **LLM Services:** `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`, `GROK_API_KEY`
     - **Speech-to-Text Services:** `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`
     - **Local Models:** `OLLAMA_API_URL` (defaults to "http://localhost:11434")
     - **Language Settings:** `RECOGNITION_LANGUAGE` (defaults to "en-US")
   - **Minimum Requirements:** You need at least one LLM provider and one STT provider to use the application.

4. **Ollama Setup (Optional)**  
   To use local AI models:
   - Install Ollama from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
   - Pull models using `ollama pull <model_name>` (e.g., `ollama pull llama3`)
   - The application will automatically detect available models

5. **FFmpeg Installation**  
   FFmpeg is required for audio processing. Download FFmpeg from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org) and follow the instructions for Windows.  
   For a step-by-step guide, watch this YouTube tutorial: [How to Install FFmpeg on Windows](https://youtu.be/JR36oH35Fgg?si=MoabHE-pi3NrJo4U).

## Building Standalone Executables

The application can be packaged as a standalone executable for Windows, macOS, and Linux using PyInstaller.

### Prerequisites
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- For Windows: Have Python and pip in your PATH
- For macOS: May need to install Xcode command line tools
- For Linux: Ensure python3-tk is installed system-wide

### Building

**Windows:**
```batch
build_windows.bat
```
The executable will be in `dist/MedicalAssistant.exe`

**macOS:**
```bash
./build_macos.sh
```
The app bundle will be in `dist/MedicalAssistant.app`

**Linux:**
```bash
# First, ensure FFmpeg is installed:
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg  # For Ubuntu/Debian
# or
sudo dnf install ffmpeg      # For Fedora
# or
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg        # For Arch

# Then build:
./build_linux.sh
```
The executable will be in `dist/MedicalAssistant`

**Important for Linux:** Run the application using the launcher script:
```bash
./dist/linux_launcher.sh
```
This ensures system FFmpeg libraries are used correctly.

### Distribution Notes
- The executable includes all Python dependencies
- Users still need to have FFmpeg installed separately
- API keys can be configured via the application's settings dialog
- First run may be slower as antivirus software scans the executable

### Desktop Shortcuts (Optional)
Create desktop shortcuts for easy access:

**Windows:**
```batch
create_desktop_shortcut.bat
```

**Linux:**
```bash
./install_desktop_entry.sh
```

**macOS:**
Desktop shortcuts are automatically created during the build process.

   python main.py
   ```

2. **Setting Up AI Provider**
   - Select your preferred AI provider from the dropdown (OpenAI, Perplexity, Grok, or Ollama)
   - For cloud services, ensure you've entered valid API keys
   - For Ollama, click "Test Ollama Connection" in settings to verify your setup

3. **Main Workflow Tabs**

   - Choose between opening the logs directory or viewing logs directly in the application
   - Logs automatically rotate to keep only the last 1000 entries, preventing excessive disk usage

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

- **API Keys**: If you need to update API keys after startup, use the "API Keys" option in the settings menu.

- **Context Panel Issues**: 
  - Context panel is accessed via the "Context" button, not a tab
  - Context text is automatically preserved during SOAP recordings
  - Use "New Session" or the "Clear Context" button to clear previous medical information
  - Context is included as "Previous medical information" in SOAP note generation

- **Chat Interface Issues**:
  - If chat suggestions don't appear, ensure you have content in the active tab
  - Use keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+/` (`Cmd+/` on Mac) to quickly access chat
  - Chat context is based on the currently active tab

- **Queue System Issues**:
  - Monitor the status bar for queue progress
  - If recordings are stuck in queue, check the logs for errors
  - Disable "Quick Continue Mode" if you prefer sequential processing

- **Ollama Connection Issues**: If you experience timeouts with Ollama models, try:
  - Using a smaller model variant (e.g., `mistral:small` instead of `mistral:7b`)
  - Ensuring your computer has adequate resources (CPU/RAM)
  - Testing your connection with the "Test Ollama Connection" button

- **Audio/Recording Issues**:
  - Ensure FFmpeg is properly installed and accessible
  - Check microphone permissions in your operating system
  - Verify your selected audio device in the application settings

- **Performance Issues**:
  - Close unused tabs and applications to free up system resources
  - For large context text, consider breaking it into smaller sections
  - Use local Ollama models if experiencing cloud API rate limits

### **Getting Help**

- **Application Logs**: Check application logs through Help ‚Üí View Logs for detailed error information
- **Database Issues**: Use the migration tools if you encounter database errors after updates
- **Settings Reset**: Delete the application's settings files to reset to defaults if needed
