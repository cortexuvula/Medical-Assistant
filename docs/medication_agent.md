# Medication Agent Integration

## Overview
The Medication Agent is a specialized AI agent designed to handle medication-related tasks in the Medical Assistant application. It provides comprehensive medication analysis capabilities including extraction, interaction checking, dosing validation, and prescription generation.

## Features

### 1. Medication Extraction
- Extract medications from clinical text or SOAP notes
- Identify generic and brand names
- Capture dosage, route, frequency, and duration
- Extract indication when mentioned

### 2. Drug Interaction Checking
- Check for drug-drug interactions between multiple medications
- Categorize interactions by severity (Contraindicated, Major, Moderate, Minor)
- Provide clinical significance and recommended actions
- Suggest monitoring requirements

### 3. Dosing Validation
- Validate medication dosing based on patient factors
- Consider age, weight, and renal function
- Identify inappropriate dosing
- Provide specific recommendations for adjustments

### 4. Alternative Suggestions
- Suggest alternative medications when needed
- Consider reason for change (side effects, cost, etc.)
- Provide advantages and disadvantages of alternatives
- Include switching instructions

### 5. Prescription Generation
- Generate properly formatted prescriptions
- Include all necessary prescription elements
- Add important instructions and warnings
- Consider patient-specific factors

### 6. Comprehensive Analysis
- Perform complete medication review
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Flag safety concerns
- Suggest missing medications for conditions

## Database Schema

The medication agent uses the following database tables:

### medications
- Reference table for medication information
- Stores generic names, brand names, drug classes
- Includes dosage forms, strengths, and routes
- Contains contraindications and warnings

### patient_medications
- Tracks current and past medications for patients
- Links to recordings for context
- Stores dose, frequency, status, and indication
- Includes prescriber and pharmacy information

### medication_history
- Audit trail of medication changes
- Tracks who made changes and when
- Records reason for changes
- Maintains previous values

### drug_interactions
- Database of known drug interactions
- Severity levels and clinical significance
- Management recommendations

### medication_alerts
- Safety alerts for patients
- Types: allergy, interaction, duplicate therapy, dosing, contraindication
- Acknowledgment tracking

## Integration Points

### AI Processor
The `AIProcessor` class includes methods for medication analysis:
- `analyze_medications()` - Main entry point for all medication tasks
- `extract_medications_from_soap()` - Extract medications from SOAP notes
- `check_medication_interactions()` - Check interactions between medications
- `validate_medication_dosing()` - Validate dosing appropriateness

### UI Integration
- **Generate Tab**: Added "Medication Analysis" button for comprehensive medication review
- **Process Tab**: Can auto-extract medications from transcripts
- **Chat Tab**: Interactive medication queries and counseling

### Agent Manager
The medication agent is fully integrated with the agent management system:
- Configurable through agent settings dialog
- Supports all standard agent features (retry logic, sub-agents, performance metrics)
- Tools available through the tool registry

## Configuration

### Default Settings
```python
{
    "enabled": False,  # Enable in settings to use
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "temperature": 0.2,  # Lower for accuracy
    "max_tokens": 600,
    "system_prompt": "..."  # Comprehensive medication prompt
}
```

### Enabling the Agent
1. Open Settings â†’ Agent Settings
2. Select "Medication" tab
3. Check "Enable Agent"
4. Configure model and parameters as needed
5. Save settings

## Usage Examples

### Extract Medications
```python
processor = AIProcessor()
result = processor.extract_medications_from_soap(soap_note_text)
if result["success"]:
    medications = result["metadata"]["medications"]
```

### Check Interactions
```python
medications = ["Warfarin 5mg", "Aspirin 81mg", "Simvastatin 40mg"]
result = processor.check_medication_interactions(medications)
if result["success"]:
    print(result["text"])  # Interaction analysis
```

### Validate Dosing
```python
medication = {
    "name": "Metformin",
    "dose": "1000mg",
    "frequency": "twice daily"
}
patient_factors = {
    "age": 75,
    "weight": "65kg",
    "renal_function": "moderate impairment"
}
result = processor.validate_medication_dosing(medication, patient_factors)
```

## Safety Considerations

1. **Clinical Judgment**: The agent emphasizes that all recommendations require clinical judgment
2. **Patient Safety**: Dangerous interactions are flagged as HIGH PRIORITY
3. **Validation**: All dosing recommendations consider patient-specific factors
4. **Documentation**: All medication analyses are logged and can be saved to patient records

## Future Enhancements

1. **Drug Database Integration**: Connect to external drug databases (e.g., RxNorm, DrugBank)
2. **Formulary Checking**: Integrate with insurance formularies
3. **Medication Reconciliation**: Automated reconciliation workflows
4. **Patient Education**: Generate patient-friendly medication information
5. **Adherence Monitoring**: Track and analyze medication adherence patterns
6. **Cost Analysis**: Include medication cost comparisons
