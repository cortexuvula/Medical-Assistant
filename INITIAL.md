## FEATURE:

Bidirectional translation

## EXAMPLES:

When I am seeing a patient that cannot speak english I want them to speak in their own language and the application will then do STT on their speech and show an english translation to me. I will then type my response and the application will create TTS audio and play that to the patient.
